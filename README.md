# Regression Analysis Using IPL and NHL Data with Python

## NHL Data to Estimate Multiple Regression Models leading to Team Win %
### National Hockey League team statistics data from 2010 to 2017 was used in order to analyze how different team level statistics affected winning percentage. This regression analysis focused on using multiple regression, regression for categorical variables, and regression with an interaction item to test the statistics of goals for, goals against, goals for per game, goals against per game, regular season or playoffs games and combinations of all the above to see how the winning percentage of a team was affected.

## IPL Data to Determine affect of Player Statistics on Salary
### Indian Premier League player data from the 2018 season was used to determine by regression analysis the affect that a players on field performance had on the salary they were paid. This analysis first took into account the players primary position. If the player was primarily a batsman then runs scored, outs, and balls faced were used along with different equations based on those statistics to determine how they each affected the salary for which the player made. For primary bowlers runs conceded, wickets, and balls bowled were used in a variety of equestions to conduct regression on the players salary.
